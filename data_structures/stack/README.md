## Stacks
From wikipedia, " a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

- **push** - adds an element to the collection, and
- **pop** - removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out)."
